							<h2>Gryffindor</h2>
							<p>
								Gryffindor house is where you would find the pluckiest and most
								daring students (there’s a reason the house symbol is the brave
								lion). The house colours are scarlet and gold, and the Head of
								House is Professor Minerva McGonagall. If the Sorting Hat placed
								you here, you would have demonstrated qualities like courage,
								bravery and determination. Some of the wizarding world’s best
								and brightest belonged to this house – Harry Potter and Albus
								Dumbledore are just a couple that spring to mind! If you are
								lucky enough to end up in Gryffindor, we imagine you’re the type
								of person who likes to stand up for the little guy, challenges
								authority, has a tendency to act first and think later, is known
								as a class clown and takes board games very seriously. Read more

								<h2>Slytherin</h2>
								<p>
									While it is true that a lot of dark witches and wizards were
									sorted into Slytherin, not all who belong to this house are
									bad. In fact, there are a lot of excellent qualities the
									Sorting Hat looks for in potential Slytherins and Merlin
									himself even belonged to this misunderstood house! The house
									colours for Slytherin are silver and emerald green and the
									emblem is a serpent. The Head of House is Professor Severus
									Snape. If the Sorting Hat placed you in this noble house, then
									you are most likely ambitious, shrewd and possibly destined
									for greatness. We can imagine you’re the kind of person who is
									always one step ahead, has a dark sense of humour, thinks
									reputation is important, takes pride in their appearance and
									doesn’t let anyone see their soft side. Read more

							<h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
							<p>
								Hufflepuff is where you will find the most trustworthy and
								hardworking students. In fact, out of all the houses Hufflepuff
								has produced the least number of dark witches and wizards. The
								badger is the symbol of this house, the colours are yellow and
								black, the Head of House is Professor Pomona Sprout. There is an
								idea that Hufflepuffs are the least clever of all Hogwarts
								students – but that is not true. Hufflepuffs are just the most
								humble of all the houses and don’t feel the need to shout about
								their achievements in the same way as the others. If you were
								lucky enough to be sorted into this house, we can imagine you’re
								the type of person who has a strong moral compass, always works
								hard, is the most loyal friend, knows it is the taking part that
								counts and always has the best snacks. Read more

								<h2>Ravenclaw</h2>
								<p>
									If you are looking for the brainiest students – you would find
									them in Ravenclaw (with a couple of notable exceptions like
									Hermione Granger). The Ravenclaw colours are blue and bronze,
									the emblem is an eagle, the Head of House is Professor Filius
									Flitwick. The Sorting Hat would only put you in this house if
									you demonstrated excellent wisdom, wit and a skill for
									learning. Ravenclaws are often known for being quite eccentric
									and most of the great wizarding inventors and innovators have
									come from this house. We can imagine that you would get to sit
									up in Ravenclaw Tower, while surveying the excellent views, if
									you’re the type of person who analyses everything, is an
									overachiever, can be described as away with the fairies, is
									not afraid to be an individual and has a head stuffed full of
									interesting facts. Read more
